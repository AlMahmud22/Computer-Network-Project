# Computer-Network-Project

The project involved selecting an idea from a previous project, designing the network topology with routers placed on each floor, and restructuring the subnet and host arrangement for future modifications. Subnetting was managed to align with the network topology, including performing necessary calculations and documenting the process. The OSPF routing protocol was implemented for dynamic routing, and VLANs were planned and correctly implemented with proper documentation.
